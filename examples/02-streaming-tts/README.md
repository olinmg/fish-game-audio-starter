# 02 - Streaming TTS

Speaks an LLM's reply **while it's still being generated**, using Fish's live TTS WebSocket.
This is the key latency trick for responsive NPC dialogue: instead of `LLM finishes -> TTS
starts`, text streams into Fish token-by-token and audio starts coming back before the whole
sentence exists.

## Why streaming matters

A player's perceived response time is `(time to first LLM token) + (time to first audio
chunk)`, not the time for the whole reply. Calling TTS only after the LLM finishes adds the
*entire* LLM generation time to that budget. Streaming overlaps the two: Fish starts
synthesizing as soon as it has enough text, in parallel with the LLM still generating the
rest.

## Run it

```bash
cp ../../.env.example ../../.env   # from repo root, then add FISH_API_KEY
uv run stream_tts.py "Let me cross the bridge"       # saves out/stream.mp3
uv run stream_tts.py "Let me cross the bridge" --play # also plays it (needs ffmpeg/ffplay)
uv run stream_tts.py --dry-run                        # prints mock NPC tokens, no Fish call
```

With no `LLM_API_KEY` set, `game.py` uses a **MOCKUP** reply (fixed line, yielded word by
word with small delays, to simulate an LLM's token stream). Set `LLM_API_KEY` (+ optionally
`LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`) to use a real OpenAI-compatible model instead.

Console output logs latency so you can tune it:

```
[MOCKUP] token: '[sighs]'
[tts] first audio chunk after 0.412s
[tts] done, 7 chunks, total 1.203s
[tts] saved to out/stream.mp3
```

## Chunking and flush tips

- Fish's `/v1/tts/live` buffers incoming text and starts synthesizing in sentence-ish-sized
  pieces; you don't need to send whole sentences at once, just send text as it arrives.
- Send a `FlushEvent` when you want to force whatever's buffered to synthesize *now* --
  typically right after a sentence boundary (`. `, `! `, `? `) -- so the player hears that
  clause without waiting on the rest of the reply. See the comment in `stream_tts_raw.py`.
- Don't send single characters; a few words per piece is a good balance of latency vs.
  how natural the prosody sounds.

## Files

- `game.py`: the NPC's "brain" -- `NPC_PROMPT`, `GAME_STATE`, and `stream_npc_reply()`
  (the async generator of text pieces). **This is where your game code goes.**
- `stream_tts.py`: wires `game.py`'s generator into Fish's WebSocket TTS via the Python SDK
  (`client.tts.stream_websocket`). Logs time-to-first-audio and total time.
- `stream_tts_raw.py`: the same thing over the raw WebSocket + MessagePack protocol, no SDK
  dependency -- useful if your game engine (Unity, Godot, ...) can't pull in the Python SDK
  but can speak WebSocket + MessagePack directly.
- `js/`: a tiny Node.js port of `stream_tts.py` using the `fish-audio` npm package's
  `convertRealtime`. Node-only (the realtime JS client uses Node's `ws`).

## For game engines

Both scripts here save `mp3` for simplicity. In a real game engine, request
`format="pcm"` instead -- it skips encode/decode overhead entirely, which matters when
you're trying to start playback the instant the first bytes arrive.
